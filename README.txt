Hello
This is the tutorial for the game called RoCard.
The main point of the game is to train your memories.

Game process:
1. Game starts with the greeting, and choosing the size of the playing field
2. After that, the main part of the game starts
3. You need to pick two different coordinates on the shown field and then cards under the coordinates will be exposed
4. If chosen cards are identical, You've guessed! Guessed cards won't be hidden again
5. Your goal if to guess all cards on the field. Good luck!

There are two versions of the game:
1. RoCard_SmE (Smile Edition) - uses smiles as game cards
2. RoCars_SpE (Special Symbol Edition) - uses special symbols as game cards
We recommend you to use SpE version, as it's more likely to work in your terminal
(But SmE is better)

Warning!
Game is designed for Windows-like terminals and may work incorrectly in other environments
